# Datathon Project

## Overview
Built in a team of four, this project is a full-stack web application that predicts patient health risk from vital signs and displays real-time probability outputs.

## Key Features
- Full-stack health risk prediction web app using a k-NN classifier with K-fold cross-validation  
- Predicts patient risk from vital signs with real-time probability distributions  
- Achieved ~99% accuracy across groups (per cross-validation evaluation)
